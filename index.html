Explanation Paragraph ----- About Section

You live a boring and pitiful life.

Or at least you did. 

So begins your journey.

SO BEGINS YOUR JOURNEY 

You have never been, and will never be, wrong. 

You graduated Harvard with a 4.01 GPA (by legimitate means, of course).

You are renwoned as the penultimate master in your field, a year ago resigning from your prominent role as 'IT Manager in charge of Information Technology Management' at Activision/Blizzard (with no internal pressure to do so, of course).

You, after much searching (through your contacts list), were offered an extremely well paying job very much in desperate need of workers of your "skill" (not just because of your connections, of course). 

Today is your first day. 

Continue

CONTINUE 

You walk into the pompous HQ of The Los Angeles United School District in pristine downtown Los Angeles, as the new head of thier IT department

Seconds after you set up your desk, you recieve a phone call.

It is from the Superintendent of the school district, and after welcoming her old friend (you) to her administration, she loudly complains about how her computer isn't working (she mentions someting about it being frozen), and wants her good friend to fix it for her. You internally debate between trying to help her yourself, or moving onto more important things. {A dark voice tugs at the back of your mind, urging you to return to your old ways}

Suggest she turns it off and on again. 

Refer her to a suboordinate.

Scream mysoginistic comments into the mic.

REFER HER TO A SUBOORDINATE 

The voice accepts being transferred, but suggests dissapointment

Your Employee Satisfaction has decreased. [emp-1]

Your Day Progresses

SCREAM MYSOGINISTIC COMMENTS INTO THE MIC.

The superintendant makes a comment about how it was a mistake to pull some strings to hire you after all of the negative PR over your last job. 

You proudly smile into the void. 

You are then promptly fired. 

Severance Package: 500,000$ USD [money+500000]

End of Game Report

SUGGEST SHE TURNS IT OFF AND ON AGAIN

You pass on the advice, and after a few minutes, she thanks you for your hard work and suggests you will be recieving a 10% raise, wishing you well in your new position.

You have been given a raise. Your employee satisfaction has increased. [rse+0.3] [emp+1]

Your Day Progresses

YOUR DAY PROGRESSES

[day=4] After requesting the admin password for your computer from the superintendant (you were told that she is the only one with it, as security is extremely important to her), you learn that she is on a vacation to Florida in the middle of the school year, and won't be back for a while.

Four days later, she inputs it from, to your chagrin, a sticky note on her desk so you are able to install internet explorer on your computer

You Installed It!

YOU INSTALLED IT!

Still upset about the hipcoracy, you privatly distress that nobody else seems to understand how much superrior Internet Explorer is to any other browser, and installing it on your computer shoud have been the district's number 1 priority.

Of course it is superrior, because you believe it to be superrior, as you grew up using it, and you also never have been, and never will be wrong.

You decide to spend the rest of your day campaigning for internet explorer to become the default browser used on school computers, but are shut down by the rest of your edpartnment whne they point out that all students use chromebooks.

You can now (actually) get to work. 

GET TO WORK.

[day+1] You first debate on weather to spend your day: 

Signing PO forms so that computers and other equiptment are shipped out to schools in desperate need of them, which some have been waiting months for

Contemplating which websites and programs are hurting student productivity

Pursuing a pay raise with the superintendant

SIGNING PO FORMS

After further consideration, you decide that the students can wait, and choose instead to contemplate which websites are hurting student productivity in an effort to curry favor with your high-ups

CONTEMPLATE WHICH WEBSITES ARE HURTING STUDENT PRODUCTIVITY 

After being briefed on the subject by an intern, you are given a list of websites that are potentially harmful to student productivity

Look over the list

CONTEMPLATING 

After being briefed on the subject by an intern, you are given a list of websites that are potentially harmful to student productivity

Look over the list

LOOK OVER THE LIST
The list is neatly organized into the website domain, the reason why it's on the list, the traffic volume, yadda yadda yadda (you just want to get it over with). 

You skim over the list, and eventually narrow down what services should be blocked to 4:

1: Github, an industry standard repository tool for storing and collaborating on programming projects, 

2: Unity, an industry standard game development engine that is extremely popular for its plethora of in-depth tutorials for students to guide them in gma edevelopment,

3: Google RDS, a service that allows for students to remotely access other computers, but also is required for many other cloud based programs taught in schools such as the Coomputer-Aided Design software Fusion360.

4: The LAUSD website (it has extremely high traffic volume, and the higher-ups are concerned it is distracting students whenever they power on thier computer)

You, rather bored, must now think of what to tell the intern to pass on to the Security team. 

1: Decide to roll a dice
2: Decide to block all of them
3: Decide this is too much work, hand it off to a suboordinate, and go home [f=2]

ROLL A DICE

You roll a D6 die that you confiscated from a student while touring a school after the district banned fun, and the result is: [a=1d4][a]

After passing on your intent, the intern, being a student who uses some of those programs, presents a valid argument as to why that was a bad idea. You, knowing better than she does, decide to fire her on the spot. 

After a long day's worth of work, you decide to go home. [f=1]

BLOCK ALL OF THEM

After passing on your intent, the intern, being a student presents a valid argument as to why that was a bad idea. You, knowing better than she does, decide to fire her on the spot. 

After a long day's worth of work, you decide to go home. [f=1]

GO HOME

Tonight is your [1d100]rd birthday, so you decide to celebrate quietly by reading a book and watching some VHS movies (you actually really dislike computers, but money is money). 

[roll = 1d1] You go home and sleep.

[roll == 0] You died in your sleep. You will now not have to deal with any of the repruccisoones of your horrible decisions that negitivly impacted the tens of thousands of students you were meant to help. 

[roll ==0] End of Game Report

[roll ==1] When you wake up the following morning, you find out that you have been fired, after there was so much backlash by news outlets the district was afrarid of being sued (you don't know why that would happen, but you're too in shock.)

[roll==1 and f==1] The superindendant calls you in hollow consolation, but makes it clear it was your job or hers, after you fired a female intern in a tech field for just existing. 
[roll==1 and f==2] The superindendant calls you in hollow consolation, but makes it clear it was your job or hers, after the decisions made by your suboordinate caused extreme negative PR for the district, after every single major news outlet reported on the loud complaints by teachers across the district.

[roll ==1] However, you don't care too much, because your severance and pension will allow you to live comfortable for the rest of your life, at the cost of taxpayers. 

[roll==1] Also, you will now not have to deal with any of the repruccisoones of your horrible decisions that negitivly impacted the tens of thousands of students you were meant to help. 

You Win!

[roll ==1] End of Game Report

PURSUING 

You decide to make a visit to the superintendant's office to discuss your future raise, but you find that she is away at a GroundBreaking Ceremony for a new school, taking credit for the money the government provided and the work that countless others did.

You decide to ignore those thoughts, and tell her secretarty: {You will be back at 4:00, the scheduled time for the ceremony to end; You will wait for her return; Something mysoginistic}

YOU WILL BE BACK 

You tell the secretary you will be back at the scheduled time, and decide to spend the next several hours making sure that your suboordinates are being as productive as possible. 

After trying to correct several of them on issues you see in thier work, you are repeatedly embarressed when they know more than you, and are proven right. You decide to quietly sit at your desk pretending to do work until she returns.

YOU WILL WAIT 

You decide to wait 4 hours in the superindendant's office playing video games, until she comes back. 

The irony is not lost on her sectrary, who confronts you over your wasting of taxapayer money

When the superintendant returns, she chastises you for your wasting of time. 

You leave without a raise, and the superintendant reiterates that this behavior will not be tolerated

[emp-1] Your employee satisfaction has decreased.

While you leave, the secretary looks up from her phone, smiling

Youve learned nothing

YOUVE LEARNED NOTHING

You sent most of your day playing video games pursuing a raise, so now it's time to go home. 

In hopes of getting back into the superindendant's good graces, you decide to contemplate which websites are hurting student productivity

SOMETHING MYSOGINISTIC

You are placed on administrative leave by HR after a news outlet leaks the story.

You are eventually terminated

Severance Package: 500,000$ USD 
[money+500000]

Time on paid leave: 14 days
[money+100000]

End of Game Report

SHE RETURNS

After a lengthy conversation about how technology is ruining student productivity, she decides to give you a raise on the condition that you crack down on distractions to students that involve technology. You thank her and leave. 

[emp+1][rse+0.1] Your employee satisfaction has increased. You have been given a raise. 

In hopes of further increasing your already bloated wage, you decide to contemplate which websites are hurting student productivity to curry more favor with those above you.

END OF GAME REPORT
[1st] [money = money times rse times day]
You earned [money] dollars in [day] day[s]

Congrats! You win! You took an unreasonable amount of taxpayer money for doing *almost* no work! You truly became ingrained in the school board work culture.

Try Again

EXPLANATION PARAGRAPH

Background: When given an oppurtunity to express my disdain for LAUSD's backwards policies that in my mind are extremely counterintuititive, I took it, and now here you are playing (or probably about to play) this game I made about how much LAUSD hates students making things exactly like this. Ironic, wouldn't you say?

ABOUT SECTION
This game is coded in javascript, using HTML and CSS to form the webpage. Combined, it is over 3000 lines of code, and took way more hours than it should've to code. 

The game uses some random fucntions to make the game slightly different (almost) every playthrough.

When you play through the game, values are stored for how much of a raise you've received in total, how much employee satisfaction you have, and how much money you have accimulated. 

All of this factors into how much money you recieve at the end of the game, and maybe the goal is to get as much money as possible, but maybe not! Perhaphs you just wish to be a vile human being or ruin other people's education. the possibilities are finite!
